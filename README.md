Weather Information Web Application with Vanilla JavaScript.

Description:

Designed and developed a microservices-based web application from scratch using pure JavaScript (ES5 and ES6) to retrieve weather information from the free API provided by Weatherstack (https://weatherstack.com/). Additionally, incorporated various features and techniques such as destructuring in JavaScript, and explored data storage mechanisms using localStorage.

Key Features and Technologies:
1. API Integration: Leveraged the Weatherstack API to fetch real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for specified locations.
2. Microservices Architecture: Built the application with a modular microservices architecture, separating different functionalities into smaller, independent services for improved scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
3. Frontend Development: Utilized vanilla JavaScript (ES5 and ES6) to develop the frontend of the application, focusing on building a responsive and user-friendly interface to display weather information.
4. Destructuring in JavaScript: Demonstrated proficiency in ES6 features like destructuring to efficiently extract data from objects and arrays, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
5. Local Data Storage: Implemented localStorage to store user preferences, such as selected locations or user settings, locally within the browser. 
6. Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensured compatibility across different web browsers by writing clean and standardized JavaScript code, adhering to best practices and industry standards.
7. User Experience (UX) Design: Focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface (UI), incorporating modern design principles and interactive elements to enhance the overall user experience.
